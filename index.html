He was also a political activist, preacher, faith healer, and a preacher. Jones founded the Peoples Temple, an innovative religious movement between 1955-1978. Jones and his &quot;revolutionary suicidal&quot; inner circle organized a mass murder-suicide at Jonestown (Guyana) on November 18, 1978. Jonestown and the events at Jonestown are a significant influence on society&rsquo;s perception of cults.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones&#39;s love for Pentecostalism was evident as a child. He also wanted to preach. In the Independent Assemblies of God, Jones was ordained a Christian minister. This led to him attracting his first followers. Jones&#39; popularity was based on his appearances during the campaign with Joseph Mattsson&ndash;Boze and William Branham, who endorsed his ministry. Jones was the founder of the Peoples Temple, which would be located in Indianapolis in 1955. Jones became influenced in 1956 by Father Divine and Peace Mission. Jones&#39; civil rights activism was what made him stand out. He founded the Temple, a fully integrated congregation, as well as Christian socialism. Jones was ordained a minister in 1964 by the Disciples. This was partly due to Jones&#39;s attraction to the Disciples because of their freedom and tolerance for differing views.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Jones </span><span>moved California&#39;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Temple in 1965. In San Francisco, Jones founded the group and became heavily involved with charitable and political activity in the 1970s. Jones established connections with prominent California politicians. He was appointed chairman of the San Francisco Housing Authority Commission (San Francisco Housing Authority Commission) in 1975. Reports of abuse started to surface in the late 1960s as Jones became more vocal in his rejection for traditional Christianity. He began promoting a type of communism he called &quot;Apostolic Socialism&quot; while making claims about his own divinity. Jones began to exert more control over his Peoples Temple followers. It had over 3,000 members at its peak. Jones&#39;s followers lived a communal lifestyle, where they gave all of their income and property over to Jones and Peoples Temple. They also managed all aspects of the community.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones, after a period in which there was negative media attention and reports of abuse at Peoples Temple were reported, ordered the construction in Guyana of Jonestown commune. Many of his followers were convinced or forced to live there. Jones claimed he was building a socialist paradise that would be free from the oppression imposed by the United States government. In 1978, there were reports of human rights abuses in Jonestown and people being held against their will. Leo Ryan, U.S. Representative led a team to the commune to investigate these claims in November 1978. Ryan, along with four other former Temple members, boarded a return flight. However, Jonestown gunmen shot Ryan and the others. Jones ordered a mass killing-suicide which claimed the lives 909 people, 304 of whom were children. The members also died after drinking Flavor Aid laced in cyanide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&nbsp;Early life</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;James Warren Jones was the son of Lynetta and James Thurman Jones. He was born in Crete, Indiana on May 13, 1931. Jones&#39;s father was a World War I veteran with severe breathing difficulties. He sustained these injuries during a chemical weapons attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;Due to the death of his father, financial difficulties ensued. The Jones family was expelled from their home in 1934 for failing to make mortgage payments. Their relatives purchased a shack to be their home in the nearby town Lynn. Jones grew-up in </span><span>the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;home without electricity or plumbing. After Jones&#39;s father died, the family tried again to earn an income by farming. They relied heavily on the financial support of their extended families to provide food for their family, which often left them hungry. To supplement their diet, they sometimes foraged in nearby forests and fields.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Multiple Jones biographers have stated that Jones&#39; mother &quot;lacked natural maternal instincts,&quot; and she often neglected her son. Jones began to go to school when his extended family threatened him with losing their financial support if his mother did not get a job. She was forced to work outside of her home and she lost her job. Jones&#39;s father was admitted to the hospital multiple times. Jones&#39;s childhood was characterized by his absence from his parents. Jones was cared for by his neighbors and family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Early religious and political influences</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Myrtle Kennedy (the wife of the Nazarene Church pastor) developed a special bond with Jones. Jones received a Bible from her, and she encouraged him to read it. This helped him learn the holiness code for the Nazarene church. Jones began attending services at all the Lynn churches, going to many every week. He was also baptized in many of these churches as he grew older. Jones began to preach in private as a hobby and developed a desire for a career as a preacher when he was a child. His mother claimed that her son was acting out the pastor at the Apostolic Pentecostal Church in the area. He refused to attend the church&#39;s services, and she tried unsuccessfully to stop him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones&#39;s poor circumstances made them sympathize with him, but Jones&#39; neighbors claimed that Jones was an extraordinary child who was obsessed by religion and death. One Jones biographer suggests that Jones developed his unusual interests as a result of difficulty making friends. While his bizarre religious practices were the most noticeable to his neighbors they also noted that he was more serious about his misbehavior. He was a frequent thief of candy from the local shops. His mother was ordered to pay for these thefts. Jones was known for using offensive profanity and greeting neighbors and friends by saying &quot;Good morning, you son-of-a-bitch&quot; or &quot;Hello you dirty bastard&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones had a keen interest in religion and social doctrines. Jones became a voracious reader, reading extensively about Adolf Hitler and Karl Marx. He used to spend hours at the local library and brought home books so that he could continue reading in the evenings. Jones didn&#39;t have radical political views when he was a teenager, even though he had studied many political systems.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones spoke about his childhood saying, &quot;I was ready for death by the end of the third grade.&quot; I meant, I was so hostile and aggressive that I was willing to kill. Nobody showed me love or any understanding. A parent was required to accompany their child to school functions in those days. There was a school performance and every parent was there except mine. I stand there, all by myself. It was always me.&quot; Tom Reiterman (a biographer of Jones) wrote that Jones was attracted to religion because he wanted a family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Education and marriage</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones stood out among his peers at high school. He carried his bible almost every day. He alienated young people with his religious views. He often confronted them about their drinking habits, smoking, or dancing. Jones was upset by the treatment of African Americans at a Richmond, Indiana baseball game. Jones became aware of racism and discrimination at the Richmond baseball game.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones&#39;s parents split in 1945. They eventually divorced. Jones moved to Richmond with his mother in December 1948. He graduated from Richmond High School. Following the divorce, Jones&#39; mother and Jones lost their financial support. Jones became an orderly at Richmond Reid Hospital in 1946 to help support his family. Staff members later recall that Jones displayed disturbing behavior towards coworkers and patients. Jones was highly respected by the senior management. Jones was at Reid Hospital when he began to date Marceline Baldwin, a nurse in training.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones moved to Bloomington in Indiana in November 1948. At Indiana University Bloomington, Jones intended to become a physician. But he changed his mind quickly. Jones&#39;s time at University was influenced by the speech Eleanor Roosevelt gave about the plight of African Americans. He began to advocate for communism, as well as other radical political views, for the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones and Marceline continued to be friends while Jones was at college. They were married June 12, 1949. Their first home together was in Bloomington. Marceline was a nurse at the nearby hospital while Jones was at college. Jones was a Methodist and Marceline and Jones quickly got into arguments over church. Jones&#39;s opposition against the Methodist church&#39;s racial discriminatory practices was a problem early in their marriage. Jones finally gave up and began attending a local Methodist church most Sunday mornings. Jones, despite attending several churches each week, privately asked his wife to believe in atheism.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;After two years at Indiana University, Jones and his wife moved to Indianapolis in 1951. Jones attended night classes at Butler University in order to further his education. In 1961, he received a degree as a secondary educator. Jones was 20 years old when he began attending Communist Party USA gatherings in Indianapolis.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones and his family were harassed by the government for their affiliation to the Communist Party during 1952. Jones&#39; mother was once harassed in front of her colleagues by FBI agents for attending a communist meeting. Jones became annoyed by the persecution of communists here in the U.S. Jones, reminiscing on his experience in the Communist Party, said that he was frustrated by the persecution of communists in America. Infiltrate church. That was the thought that Jones had when he reflected on his participation in the Communist Party.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Peoples Temple</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones made the announcement to his wife and family in early 1952 that he would be a Methodist minister. Jones believed the church was ready &quot;to put real socialism into action.&quot; Jones was surprised to learn that a Methodist district superintendent helped Jones get a job in the church, even though Jones was a communist.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Jones was hired by the </span><span>Sommerset</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Southside Methodist Church as a student pastor. There he initiated a project to make a playground accessible to all races. Jones continued to visit Pentecostal churches and give talks while he was serving as a Methodist student minister. Jones was dismissed by the Methodist Church in early 1954 ostensibly because he stole church funds. But he claimed later that he quit the church as its leaders prohibited him from integrating blacks into the congregation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones was in Columbus, Indiana at this time in 1953. A woman there prophesied that Jones would be a great prophet and had a great ministry. Jones was surprised at the endorsement and gladly accepted the call for preaching. He then rose to the podium to give a message to his audience. Pentecostalism existed in the middle of the Healing Revival movement and Latter Rain movement during the 1950s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones convinced his wife, believing that the rapidly growing and racially integrated Latter Rain movement would give him more opportunities to become a preacher. Jones began preaching and attending the Laurel Street Tabernacle of God in Indianapolis in 1953. Jones was a healing minister at that church until 1955. He then began traveling to other Latter Rain churches and started speaking. He was a guest speaker at the Detroit Convention in 1953.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Latter Rain movement was opposed strongly by the Assemblies of God. 1955 saw them assign a new pastor at the Laurel Street Tabernacle. This person enforced their prohibition on healing revivals. Jones decided to leave the Laurel Street Tabernacle and start Wings of Healing. The new church was later renamed Peoples Temple. Jones&#39;s new church was only able to attract twenty members from the Laurel Street Tabernacle. It also couldn&#39;t afford to support his vision financially. Jones realized the need to get publicity for his ministry. He began looking for ways to recruit members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Latter Rain movement</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones began to associate closely with the Independent Assemblies of God (&quot;IAoG&quot;), an international group of churches who embraced Latter Rain. The IAoG didn&#39;t have strict requirements for ordaining clergymen and was open to the use of divine healing methods.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones&#39; first joint meeting was held with William Branham on June 25, 1955. Branham is a global Healing Revival healer and Pentecostal leader.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Joseph Mattsson&ndash;Boze was a leader in both the Latter Rain movement as well as the IAoG and ordained Jones to be an IAoG Minister in 1956. Jones quickly rose in prominence and organized and hosted the 1956 healing convention in Indianapolis&#39; Cadle Tabernacle. Branham was a popular figure that could draw large crowds so Jones arranged to take over the pulpit once again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">William Branham was instrumental to the popularity of Jim Jones&#39; ministry in 1956.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Branham was famous for giving attendees their name, address and reason they came for prayer before pronouncing them to be healed. Jones was impressed by Branham&rsquo;s methods and started performing the same feats. Jones and Branham had great success and attracted over 11,000 people at their first campaign together. Branham, who spoke prophetically at the convention, supported Jones&#39; ministry and said that God used it to launch a new ministry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Many attendees believed Jones&#39;s performance suggested he had a supernatural gift. It was combined with Branham&#39;s endorsement that led to rapid growth at People&#39;s Temple. Jones was particularly successful in recruiting African American participants to the conventions. According to a newspaper report the Peoples Temple&#39;s regular attendance grew to 1,000 due to the publicity Branham provided.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones renamed his church &quot;Peoples Temple Christian Church Full Gospel&quot; after the convention to better associate it with Full Gospel Pentecostalism. Later, the name was changed to Peoples Temple. Jones participated in several multi-state revival campaigns that Branham led in the second half of the 1950s. Jones claimed to have been a follower and advocate of Branham&rsquo;s &quot;Message&rdquo; during that period. Peoples Temple hosted the 1957 second international Pentecostal conference, which was once again led by Branham. Jones gained connections to the Latter Rain movement by attending the conventions, and thanks to the support of Mattsson Boze and Branham.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones adopted the Manifested Sons of God doctrine, one of the Latter Rain&#39;s most important doctrines. He continued to promote it for the rest of Jones&#39; life. William Branham and Latter Rain believed that individuals could be made into manifestations of God through supernatural abilities and other superhuman gifts. They believed such a manifestation was a sign of Christ&#39;s second coming and that people with special gifts would usher in the millennial age of paradise on earth. Jones was fascinated by the idea. He used it to promote his utopian ideas. Eventually, he believed that he was God himself. Jones taught that he was Christ the Revolution by the end of the 1960s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Branham was an important influence on Jones. He adopted many of Branham&rsquo;s ideas, doctrines, style, and methods. Jones, who was a representative of Christ and a return of Elijah The Prophet, would also claim to be Branham&#39;s influence. Branham taught Jones the best recruitment techniques. Following a bitter disagreement between Jones and Branham, Jones decided to separate from the Latter Rain movement. Jones even prophesied Branham&rsquo;s demise. The disagreement could have been due to Branham&rsquo;s racial teachings, or Branham&rsquo;s growing opposition to communism.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;Peace Mission Movement</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones discovered Father Divine, an African American spiritual leader in the International Peace Mission movement. Jones was frequently ridiculed by Pentecostal ministers due to his claims to divinity. Jones first visited Father Divine&#39;s Peace Mission Philadelphia in 1956. Jones made sure to explain to his fellow Pentecostal ministers that his visit to the Peace Mission was meant to give an &quot;authentic, objective, and objective account&quot; of its activities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones&#39;s ministry also had a significant influence from Divine. Jones, despite publicly discrediting many Father Divine&#39;s teachings in public, began to promote Divine teachings on communal living. Jones also implemented many of his outreach practices that he observed at the Peace Mission. This included setting up a soup pantry and providing food and clothing for those in need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones visited Father Divine again in 1958 to get more information about his practices. Jones told his congregation he wanted to be Father Divine&#39;s successor and made many comparisons between the two ministries. Jones began to apply the disciplinary methods he had learned from Father Divine. This gradually took control of the lives of Peoples Temple members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Disciples Of Christ</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones was gradually disassociated from Pentecostalism as well as the Latter Rain movement. He searched for an organization that would allow him to share all his beliefs. Peoples Temple joined Disciples of Christ, which was headquartered in Indianapolis, in 1960. Archie Ijames assured Jones they would not tolerate his political views and Jones was finally ordained as a Disciples of Christ priest in 1964.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jones was ordained a Disciples minister during a time in which the requirements for ordination varied widely and Disciples membership could be open to any church. The Peoples Temple was alleged to have been abused by the Disciples leadership in 1974 and 1977. They carried out investigations, but found no evidence that there was any wrongdoing. Disciples found Peoples Temple to have been &quot;an exemplary Christian Ministry overcoming human differences and dedicated towards human services.&quot; Peoples Temple donated $1.1million ($4,697.803 2020 dollars) between 1966-1977 to the denomination. Jones and Peoples Temple remained with the Disciples through the Jonestown massacre.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Integration of different races</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Charles Boswell, Indianapolis mayor, named Jones director of his local human rights commission in 1960. Boswell told Jones to keep his public profile low. Jones, however, used the position as a way to get new media outlets for his opinions on local radio stations and television. Jones refused to be curtailed by the mayor and other commissioners. Jones was cheered enthusiastically at a meeting of the NAACPthe Urban League when he encouraged the audience to be more militant. He concluded his speech with &quot;Let your people go!&quot; &quot;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones served as commission director. He helped to integrate restaurants, churches, telephone companies, Indianapolis Police Department, theaters, amusement parks, and Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital. Jones walked through the neighborhood after swastikas were placed on the homes of two black families. He counseled white families to not move and comforted them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones established sting operations to catch restaurants refusing to serve black customers. He wrote to American Nazi Party leaders to get their answers and sent them to the media. Jones fell ill in 1961 and was taken to the hospital. Jones was accidentally placed in the black ward by the hospital. Jones refused to be moved and started making the beds and emptying the bedpans for the black patients. Officials at the hospital decided to desegregate their wards because of political pressures resulting from Jones&#39;s actions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones was criticized in Indiana for his pro-integrationist views. Peoples Temple was a target for white supremacists. One of the many incidents was that a swastika had been placed on the Temple and that a stick with dynamite had been left in a Temple coal heap. Jones was also threatened by a phone call, so a dead cat was sent to Jones&#39;s house. Jones&#39;s activities generated more attention, though. Indianapolis was much more racially diverse by the end 1961. Jim Jones was almost entirely responsible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">&quot;Rainbow Family&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones and his spouse adopted several children of non-white race. Jones called his household a &quot;rainbow home&quot; and said: &quot;Integration with me is more personal now. It&#39;s a matter of my sons&#39; future. He also described the Temple to be a &quot;rainbow-family&quot;. Agnes Jones, a Native American part, was adopted by the Joneses in 1954.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;They adopted three Korean American children in 1959: Lew, Stephanie, &amp;amp; Suzanne. They also encouraged Temple members and others to adopt war-ravaged Korean orphans. Stephanie Jones was five years old when she was involved in a car crash in May 1959.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones and his wife, Stephan Gandhi, had their one biological child in June 1959. They were the first Indiana white couple to adopt a black child in 1961. They adopted a white boy, initially named Timothy Glen Tupper (shortened from Tim), whose mother was a Temple member. Jones and Temple member Carolyn Layton fathered Jim Jon (&quot;Kimo&quot;) together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Relocating Peoples Temple</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;Jones, in 1961, warned his congregation about visions of a devastating nuclear attack. His wife told his friends that he was growing more fearful and paranoid. Jones could have been inspired by Branham&#39;s 1961 prophecy regarding the destruction of the United States during a nuclear war, just like others who followed William Branham. Jones sought a way out of the impending destruction. He read an Esquire magazine article in January 1962 that stated South America as the safest place for escaping any imminent nuclear war. Jones decided to go to South America to search for a place to </span><span>relocate Peoples</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Temple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones made a stop at Georgetown, Guyana during his journey to Brazil. Jones held revival meetings at Guyana, an English-speaking British colony. Jones&#39;s family then moved to Brazil and rented a three-bedroom apartment in Belo Horizonte. Jones studied the local economy, and found that language was a barrier to his message. Jones avoided being portrayed as a communist by referring to an apostolic community lifestyle and not marxism. Their family moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in mid-1963. They worked in the favelas with the poor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones felt guilty for leaving Indiana&#39;s civil rights battle and was unable to find a suitable place for Peoples Temple. Peoples Temple&#39;s regular attendance dropped to less than 100 over the year Jones was absent. Jones demanded that the Peoples Temple send its entire revenue to him in South America. This was to support his efforts. To finance his mission, the church took on debt. Archie Ijames informed Jones in 1963 that the Temple was at risk of falling and threatened to resign should Jones not return. Jones reluctantly returned from Indiana.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones arrived in December 1963, to find the People&#39;s Temple deeply divided. Jones was forced to sell the Peoples Temple Church Building due to financial difficulties and low attendance and moved to a smaller facility nearby. Jones briefly returned to revival touring and holding healing sessions with Latter Rain group members in order to raise funds. He told his Indiana congregation, possibly to distract them from the problems facing their group, that the world would be destroyed by nuclear war on July 15, 1967. This would create a new socialist Eden on Earth. The Temple must then move to Northern California.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones visited California multiple times during 1964 in search of a new home. Jones and his associates moved to Redwood Valley in California near Ukiah in July 1965. Russell Winberg, Peoples Temple assistant pastor, strongly opposed Jones&#39;s efforts at moving the congregation. He also warned members about Jones&#39;s abandonment of Christianity. Winberg assumed leadership of the Indianapolis congregation after Jones left. About 140 of Jones&rsquo;s most loyal followers moved to California. The rest stayed with Winberg.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;Jones, a </span><span>Californian</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;teacher of government and history at Ukiah&#39;s adult school, took up a position in California. Jones used his position as a recruiter for Peoples Temple. He taught his students Marxism and lectured on religion. Jones enrolled Peoples Temple loyalists in his classes to assist him with recruiting. Jones recruited 50 Peoples Temple members in his first few months. Jones&#39;s followers convinced 75 other members of the Indianapolis congregation that they should move to California in 1967.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;In 1968, the California location of the Peoples Temple was admitted to The Disciples of Christ. Jones started to promote Peoples Temple as a part of the 1.5million member denomination using the denominational link. He praised famous Disciples like Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, as well as misrepresented his role in the denomination. Jones increased California&#39;s Peoples Temple membership from 300 to 300 in 1969.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Apostolic Socialism</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones developed a doctrine that was inspired by Father Divine&#39;s &quot;divine economy socialism&quot; teachings and William Branham&#39;s Latter Rain movement. Jones also incorporated Jones&#39;s communist worldview. Jones referred to his views under the name &quot;Apostolic Socialism&quot;. Jones kept communist teachings secret until the late 1960s. This was after the Peoples Temple moved to California. Jones began gradually revealing his full beliefs to his followers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones said that anyone who continued to use the opiate of religious belief had to be brought up to enlightenment, which he defined to mean socialism. Jones claimed that traditional Christianity had an incorrect understanding of God. Jones began to denigrate traditional Christianity in the 1970s as &quot;flyaway religion&quot;, and rejected the Bible&#39;s role as a tool to oppress women. Jones refers to traditional Christianity as a &quot;Sky God&quot;, who is &quot;no God at All&quot;. Jones claimed instead that Jones was following the true God, who created all things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones began to promote the notion of his own divinity and even went so far as telling his congregation, &quot;I am come as God Socialist.&quot; Jones avoided declaring divinity outside Peoples Temple. But he expected his followers to recognize him as God-like. Hue Fortson Jr., an ex-Temple member, quoted him saying:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;What you should believe &nbsp;in is what you can see . If you view me as your friend, then I will become your friend. You can see me as your dad ..... If you view me as your savior then I&#39;ll be your saver. If you view me as your God I&#39;ll become your God.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones also attacked traditional Christianity by writing and publishing a tract entitled &quot;The letter killeth&quot;, which criticizes King James Bible. He also dismisses King James for being a slave owner and capitalist responsible for the corrupt translation. Jones claimed that he was being sent to tell the truth about the gospel, which was hidden from him by corrupt leaders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones rejected all but a few of the Disciples of Christ tenets. Jones chose to follow Father Divine&#39;s holy communion rituals, instead of following the Disciples&#39; sacraments. Jones invented his own baptismal formula, and baptized his converts &quot;in honor of Socialism&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones explained the nature and consequences of sin. He stated that if you were born in America (capitalist America, racist America or fascist America), then you are in sin. If you were born in socialism, however, you won&#39;t be born in sin. On the basis of a prophecy found in the Book of Revelation he said that American capitalist culture is irredeemable and &quot;Babylon&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones often warned his followers about the imminent apocalyptic nuclear race war. He said that Nazi fascists, white supremacists, and other white supremacists would send people of color to concentration camps. Jones claimed that he was a messenger sent by God to save people. His followers learned that the only way out of the predicted imminent disaster was to accept his teachings and that they would establish a communist society after the apocalypse had ended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones was careful to keep his socialist views publically in terms of religion, such as &quot;apostolic and social justice&quot;. His euphemism for a communal lifestyle was &quot;Living the Acts of the Apostles&quot;. Jones was concerned that the United States would expose the extent of Jones&#39; communist views. He feared losing the support and loyalty of the political leaders of the country, as well as the possibility of Peoples Temple being removed from the Disciples. Jones feared losing the church&#39;s tax exemption and reporting his financial transactions to the Internal Revenue Service.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Historians differ on whether Jones believed or just used his teachings to manipulate people. Jeff Guinn stated that it was impossible to determine if Jones came to believe he is God&#39;s earthly vessel over time or if he simply used this convenient conclusion to strengthen his authority over followers. Jones claimed that he was an agnostic or atheist in a 1976 interview. Marceline said in a 1977 New York Times interview, that Jones tried to promote Marxism by mobilizing Americans through religion. She stated that Jones called the Bible a &quot;paper idol&quot; he wanted to destroy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones taught his followers the importance of the ends justifying the means. He authorized them to reach his vision using any means necessary. Jones&#39;s teachings would be criticized by outsiders for claiming that Jones did not believe in his own teachings and was morally bankrupt. He used religion and other social elements to achieve his selfish ends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Early Reports of Abuse</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones became paranoid after he moved to California and began using illegal drugs. He used fear to manipulate and control his followers. Jones regularly warned his followers about an enemy out to destroy him. The identity of this enemy has changed over the years from the Ku Klux Klan to Nazis, redneck vigilantes and then the American government. He prophesied repeatedly that anyone who was not faithful to his teachings would be subject to fires, car accidents, death, or injury. He urged his followers to be aggressive in spreading and fulfilling his beliefs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones set up a Planning Commission consisting of his lieutenants, to manage the Peoples Temples&#39; communal living arrangements. The Planning Commission gave Jones control over all aspects of his followers&#39; lives. People&#39;s Temple members turned over all of their assets to the church for free room, board and lodging. Members who did not work for the Temple gave up their income so that it could be used to benefit the community. Jones instructed his followers to work together on projects that would generate additional income. Jones also established an agricultural operation in Redwood Valley, California to grow food. Temple members were bussed to the area to work on community outreach projects and perform community service.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;California saw the Planning Commission impose discipline on members who didn&#39;t follow Jones&rsquo;s vision. This was the first case of Peoples Temple abuse. Jones&#39;s control of Peoples Temple members extended beyond their sex lives, and who could get married. Some members were coerced into having abortions. Jones began to request sexual favors for his wives from certain members of the church. He raped several men in his congregation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones&#39;s followers who rebelled against him were punished with reduced food and work schedules, humiliation, and even physical violence. Jones set up an armed security team to maintain order and ensure his personal safety as the Temple&#39;s membership grew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;San Francisco</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Peoples</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Temple was rapidly growing by the end 1969. Jones&#39;s message, which emphasized economic socialism as well as racial equity, was attractive to students and minorities, and Peoples Temple&#39;s integrated approach. Jones moved his attention from Ukiah to California in 1970 when the Temple had opened branches in many cities, including San Fernando and San Francisco. The Temple&#39;s headquarters was eventually relocated to San Francisco. This city was known for its radical protest movements. Peoples Temple had 2570 members by 1973 and 36,000 subscribers who subscribed to its fundraising newsletter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones targeted other churches in order to grow the Temple. Jones traveled with 150 followers to San Francisco&#39;s Missionary Baptist Church, where they visited the Temple in 1970. Jones led a revival of faith in faith healing where he convinced the crowd that he could heal a man from cancer. Later, his followers admitted to having helped him to stage the &quot;healing&quot;. After the event was over, Jones began attacking and condemning Baptist teachings. He encouraged his followers to join him and abandon their church.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones attracted about 200 new people to Peoples Temple after the event. Jones and many of his followers also visited the shrine and tomb built for Father Divine shortly following his death in 1971. Jones confronted Divine&#39;s widow and claimed to have become the reincarnation Father Divine. Jones&#39;s followers overtook the event at a banquet and Jones addressed Divine&rsquo;s followers. He claimed that he was Father Divine&rsquo;s successor. Divine&#39;s wife rose up to accuse Jones of being a devil disguised and demanded that Jones leave. Jones managed to attract only twelve followers at the event.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones became involved in San Francisco politics and was eventually able to make contact with state and local politicians. Due to their increasing numbers, Jones was able to play an important role in George Moscone&rsquo;s 1975 election as mayor. Moscone later appointed Jones chairman of the San Francisco Housing Authority Commission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones hosted local politicians in his San Francisco apartment. Assemblyman Willie Brown, who was also the master of ceremonies, served as the master at a testimonial dinner for Jones in September 1976. It was attended by Lieutenant Governor Mervyn Davies and Governor Jerry Brown. Willie Brown described Jones as &quot;what to see every morning when you look in your mirror&quot;, and claimed that Jones was a mix of Martin Luther King Jr. and Angela Davis and Albert Einstein. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones made connections with California politicians and was able to establish relationships with prominent national political figures. Jones and Moscone met privately on a campaign plane with Walter Mondale, the vice presidential candidate. Mondale was able to praise the Temple publicly because of this meeting. Rosalynn, the First Lady of California, met Jones multiple times and corresponded with him in Cuba. They also spoke at the San Francisco headquarters&#39; grand opening, where he received more applause than she. Jones made alliances with San Francisco Chronicle columnists and other journalists who gave Jones positive press during his first years in California.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Jonestown</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones started receiving negative press from October 1971 when reporters covered Jones&#39;s divine-healing services at his old church, Indianapolis. The Indiana State Psychology Board began an investigation into Jones&#39; healing methods in 1972 after the news report was published. Jones was charged with &quot;quackery&quot; by a doctor involved in the investigation. He challenged Jones to provide tissue samples from the material he claimed fell from people who were healed of cancer. Temple officials were alarmed at the results of the investigation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones had been performing faith healing miracles since his campaign with William Branham. His healings have been exposed to be a hoax. &quot;On multiple occasions, his healings have been revealed as nothing more than a hoax.&quot; Jones did drugs on Temple member Irene Mason. While she was unconscious, Jones put a cast on her right arm. She was then told that she had fallen and fractured her arm, and she was taken to the hospital. Jones then removed the cast from her and announced that she was healed. Jones would also have someone from his circle join the prayer line to heal cancer. After being &quot;healed&quot;, the person would pretend that they had coughed up their cancerous tumor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones pretended that he had &quot;special revelations,&quot; which allowed him to reveal certain details about people&#39;s lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones was worried that the investigation might expose his methods. Jones responded that he would end his Indiana ministry and move to California. Jones also dismissed his claims of healing to the authorities. As the matter escalated, Lester Kinsolving published several articles that targeted Jones and Peoples Temple in September 1972&#39;s San Francisco Examiner. The stories covered Jones&#39;s claims of divinity, and exposed purported miracles that were a hoax.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ross Case, an ex-follower of Jones, joined a Ukiah group to investigate Peoples Temple. They found evidence that Jones had raped a member of his congregation, staged healings, and abusive treatment of a female church member. Jones became increasingly suspicious that authorities were after Jones as he heard about Case&#39;s activities. Case reported his findings to local police, but they didn&#39;t take any action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Soon after, eight Peoples Temple members accused the Planning Commission of abusing staff members and others. Before fleeing the Peoples Temple they accused Planning Commission members as homosexuals. Jones felt he was losing his control and decided to relocate Peoples Temple, in order to escape mounting threats and accusations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones was charged with lewd misconduct for allegedly masturbating near a male undercover LAPD deputy officer in a movie theater bathroom near Los Angeles MacArthur Park. Jones was released from custody on December 20, 1973. However, details of Jones&#39; dismissal aren&#39;t clear. The court file was sealed and the judge ordered destruction of records from the arrest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;Formation</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones and the Planning Commission developed a plan to flee the United States in the case of a raid by the government. In addition, they started to plan a longer-term strategy for the relocation of Peoples Temple. Guyana was chosen by the group because of its recent revolution, socialist government, and favorable response Jones received in 1963 when he visited there. The group voted unanimously in October to create an agricultural community in Guyana. Jones and Ijames visited Guyana in December to locate a suitable site.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones said in a newspaper interview that it was his preference to establish his commune in a communist country such as China or the Soviet Union. However, he was not able to do so. Jones called Stalin and Lenin his heroes, while he viewed the Soviet Union to be an ideal society.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Guyana was able to acquire land and supplies by the end of 1974. Ijames was given the task of overseeing the installation of a power generator station, clearing fields for farming and construction of dormitories in preparation for the arrival of the first settlers. The first group arrived in Guyana on December 24, 1974 to begin operating the Jonestown commune.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;Jones left Ijames as </span><span>Jonestown&#39;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;supervisor, and he returned to America to carry on his efforts to fight the negative press. His attempts to stop the negative press were unsuccessful. More stories about abuse at Peoples Temple were made public. Marshall Kilduff published an article in New West magazine that exposed abuses at Peoples Temple in March 1977. The article contained allegations from Temple defectors that they were subject to physical, emotional and sexual abuse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones felt that it was now time to relocate permanently to South America and began to push People&#39;s Temple members to go along with him. Jones promoted the commune as a way to create a socialist paradise and hide from the scrutiny of San Francisco&#39;s media. Jones claimed to have established it as a model communist society, and that the Temple was home to &quot;the purest communists available&quot;. Jones prohibited members from leaving Jonestown once they arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jonestown was home for about 50 settlers in 1977. However, the village was not equipped to handle large numbers of settlers. Jones was warned by Ijames about the limitations of the facilities, but Jones believed that the relocation was necessary and decided to leave immediately. Jones and 600 of his followers arrived at Jonestown in May 1977. About 400 others followed them in the following months. Jones began selling American property and moved the Temple&#39;s financial resources overseas. At that time, the Peoples Temple was worth over $10 million. Jones was respected for his efforts to create a racially mixed church that would help the disadvantaged, despite negative press coverage. In fact, 68% of Jonestown residents were of African descent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Mounting pressure and declining political support</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;John Stoen was among the Jones&#39;s followers in Guyana. John&#39;s birth record listed Timothy Stoen (and Grace Stoen) as his parents. Jones had a sexual relationship to Grace Stoen. He claimed that he was John&#39;s biological father. Grace Stoen left Peoples Temple with her child in 1976. Jones ordered the child be taken by Jones to Guyana in February 1977 so that Grace could not have a custody dispute. Jonestown gave the child to Timothy Stoen, who also left Peoples Temple in June 1977.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;Timothy Stoen and other Temple defectors created a &quot;Concerned Relatives</span><span>&rdquo; organization</span><span>&nbsp;in the fall of 1977 to support Jonestown family members who were being denied permission to return to the United States. </span><span>Stoen</span><span>&nbsp;went to Washington, D.C., January 1978, to meet with State Department officials, congressional members, and to create a white paper outlining his grievances regarding Jones and Temple, as well his efforts to recover his son. California Congressman Leo Ryan became curious about Stoen&#39;s efforts, and he wrote a letter to Forbes Burnham on </span><span>Stoen&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;behalf. Concerned relatives began a legal fight with the Temple for Stoen&rsquo;s custody.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;While most of Jones&rsquo;s political allies ended their ties shortly after his departure from office, others did not. Harvey Milk and Assemblyman Art Agnos were present at the rally, where Willie Brown voiced his opposition to the Temple&#39;s supposed enemies. Mayor Moscone issued a press release stating Jones had not violated any laws.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Concerned Relatives distributed an assortment of documents, letters, affidavits and forms to members of Congress, the Peoples Temple and members of the press on April 11, 1978. They called it &quot;Accusation for Human Rights Violations By Rev. James Warren Jones&quot;. Deborah Layton, an ex-Temple member, gave the group a second affidavit detailing Temple crimes and Jonestown&#39;s living conditions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;Jones was being scrutinized more and more in 1978, when he hired JFK Assassination conspirators Mark Lane and Donald Freed. They were to help him make the case for a &quot;grand conspiracy&quot; against Temple by U.S. intelligence agency. Jones said to Lane that his goal was to &quot;pull an Eldridge </span><span>Curaver</span><span class="c1">&quot;. This refers to a Black Panthers fugitive who was later able to return home to the U.S. and rebuild his reputation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones attempted to broker for his commune&#39;s resettlement in the Soviet Union. Feodor Timofeyev was the Soviet consul in Guyana and visited Jonestown twice a day to give a speech. Jim Jones stated that for many years, his sympathies have been made public. He said, &quot;For many decades, we have let it be quite publicly known that the United States government is not our mother but that the Soviet Union is our spiritual motherland.&quot; Timofeyev declared Jonestown in harmony of theory with &quot;Marx Engels Lenin&quot; as well as the &quot;practical application of... certain fundamental features of this theory,&quot; and personally thanked Jim Jones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">White Nights</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jonestown saw Jones&#39;s paranoia rise and his drug use increase as he was afraid of a government attack on the commune. To ensure the community&#39;s resistance to an attack, Jones began holding drills. He called these drills &quot;White Nights&quot;. Jones would call out &quot;Alert,&quot; Alert, Alert over the community speaker to summon the entire community to the central pavilion. Around the pavilion were armed guards with crossbows and guns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones instructed the community members to remain at the pavilion through the drill. Jones explained that they had been attacked by agents and threatened to destroy their community. Jones led them to pray, chant, and sing in order to ward off any impending attack. Jones would often have his guards hide behind trees and fire their firearms to simulate an attack. Jones&#39;s terrified participants were only informed that they were taking part in a drill once the event was over. Six days of drills were held in September 1977.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The drills were used to keep Jonestown residents from leaving the commune. Jones believed that the attack was imminent after two visits to Jonestown by US Embassy personnel. In early 1978, an IRS investigation confirmed his suspicions. Jones stated to his followers in 1978 White Night drill that he was planning to distribute poison to all of them as an act to commit suicide. Everybody in the pavilion was offered a bowl of fruit punch. They sat down, weeping, and waited for their deaths. Jones assured his followers that this was just a drill and that they were not poisoned by the fruit punch. Jones convinced his followers, through the White Nights of Evil, that the Central Intelligence Agency CIA was actively working to devastate their community. He forced them to commit suicide to escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;1978 saw the Jonestown situation worsen. The community was tired and overworked. The majority of the community was required to do manual labor, from the early morning until the evening. Jonestown had loudspeakers installed and sermons played continuously for the benefit of all. Jones started to promote his belief in &quot;Translation&quot; when he arrived in Jonestown with his followers. He believed that everyone would eventually die and all of them would live happily in the afterlife. The workers often felt hungry and had to eat very little. After working all day, the community gathered at the central pavilion every evening to hear Jones&#39; sermon. His sermons were often long and arduous. Most of the community was sleeping poorly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The majority of community members were children or the elderly. This made it difficult for those who weren&#39;t working to keep up with their community&#39;s demands. There was a shortage of healthcare, education, or food rations, and the situation was becoming worse. Jones&#39;s increased drug use was becoming more apparent. His orders were becoming more unpredictable. Sometimes he was seen standing and sometimes his speech was slurred. He was sometimes seen urinating in public. However, this was due to prostatitis which he had suffered for a brief time at the end of Jonestown in October 1978. He was unable to walk unassisted during this period. But, Leo Ryan&#39;s intervention helped. Mary McCormick Maaga, a religious scholar and historian, claims that Jones&#39;s authority diminished after the exodus. He was always there with them every day and couldn&#39;t hide his drug addiction from his rank-and file members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Ryan Murders</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ryan led a fact finding mission to Jonestown, New York in November 1978 to investigate human-rights abuse allegations. Ryan led a fact-finding mission to Jonestown that included family members of Temple members, NBC camera crews, and reporters from various newspapers. The group arrived in Georgetown (Guyana) on November 15.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;They traveled by plane to Port Kaituma two days later and were then transported to Jonestown. Jones hosted a reception at Jonestown&#39;s central pavilion for the delegation. Vernon Gosney, a Temple Member, handed Don Harris a note he had written for Ryan, asking for assistance in leaving the settlement. Tensions rose as word spread about the plans of some Temple members to leave. Ryan&#39;s delegation hurriedly left the Temple on November 18, just as Don Sly narrowly managed to stab Ryan. Ryan and his delegation managed to get fifteen Temple members along, and Jones didn&#39;t try to stop their departure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ryan&#39;s delegation boarded two airplanes at Port Kaituma airport. Jonestown&#39;s Red Brigade of armed guards approached them and began shooting at their group. Ryan and four other people were killed by gunmen near a Guyana Airways Twin Otter plane. Larry Layton, an alleged defector, also pulled a weapon from his bag and began firing at members of the party in the Cessna. Gosney, Bagby, and others were among the victims. Bob Brown, NBC&#39;s cameraman on the ground, captured footage of the Otter&#39;s shooting moments just before he was shot and killed by the gunmen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Ryan, Harris, Brown and Greg Robinson from the San Francisco Examiner were among those killed on the airstrip. Temple member Patricia Parks was also among the victims. The attack was survived by Jackie Speier (a Ryan staff member); Richard Dwyer (Deputy Chief of Mission, U.S. Embassy, Georgetown); Bob Flick; Steve Sung; Steve Sung; Tim Reiterman; Ron Javers; Charles Krause; and several Temple defectors. To escape being killed, they ran into the jungle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Mass murder-suicide in Jonestown</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones heard that Ryan&#39;s security guards had failed to kill Ryan later in the day. Jones predicted that the escapees will soon inform the United States and send the military into Jonestown. Jones called the entire community together to the central pavilion. He informed the community Ryan was dead. It was only a matter for military commandos to descend on their commune, killing them all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones stated to Temple members that the Soviet Union wouldn&#39;t allow them passage after the shooting on the airstrip. Jones replied, &quot;We can check to Russia to see whether they&#39;ll take us in immediately, or we will die.&quot; Jones then asked, &quot;You think Russia wants us with all this stigma?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones and others argued that the group ought to commit &quot;revolutionary suicidal suicide&quot;. [a] Jones recorded all of the death rituals on audio tape. Jones had brought large amounts of cyanide to Jonestown in November 1978. Jones obtained a jewelry license which would have allowed him to purchase bulk quantities to purportedly clean the gold. Flavor Aid was mixed with cyanide to create a drink that was distributed to the community. Cyanide injections were given via syringe to anyone refusing to drink.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Christine Miller, a Temple member, voted against the tape&#39;s beginning. Jones encouraged members to stop crying and show signs of dissent when they wept. These are not the ways that communists and socialists want to die. There is no way to die. We must all die with dignity. Jones can be heard saying, &ldquo;Don&#39;t fear to die&rdquo;, adding that death was &quot;just walking over into another plane&quot;, and that death is &ldquo;a friend&quot;. Jones demanded that the children should be killed first. Marceline, Jones&#39; wife, apparently protested against the murder of the children. After the children died, Marceline was forcefully restrained by Jones. Jones said at the end of the tape that Jones had not committed suicide. She was protesting the inhumane conditions of the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The community was able to survive the event with 85 percent. Some of the survivors slipped into the jungle as the ritual began. One man hid in the ditch. One elderly lady hid in her dormitory. She woke up to find everyone dead. Jonestown&#39;s basketball team was absent for a match and managed to survive. Others went into hiding in the dormitories and were on their way to work when the ritual ended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;909 Jonestown residents were killed by mass murder-suicide, with 304 of them being children. They were mostly found around the central pavilion. This was the largest single American civilian casualty in a deliberate act, until September 11, 2001. The deaths of four other Georgetown residents were the result. The FBI later recovered the 45 minute audio recording of mass poisoning in process. The Death Tape was named after the recording.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Death and its aftermath</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jones&#39;s sons, Jim Jr., Tim Jones and Stephan Jones were among the Peoples Temple&#39;s Georgetown basketball team during the mass poisoning. Three brothers drove to Georgetown, to alert authorities, during the Jonestown events. The guards of Guyanese refused to allow the brothers in, despite hearing about the shootings on the Port Kaituma airport. Later, they returned to Georgetown to search for Sharon Amos&#39; bodies and those of her children Liane, Christa, and Martin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;To find the deceased, the Guyanese military landed in Jonestown. The United States military organized an airlift to return the remains to the United States. Jones was found lying on the ground of the central pavilion with a gunshot wound in his head. Jones&#39;s body later was moved to be examined and embalmed. Cyril Mootoo (Guyana&#39;s coroner) conducted an autopsy in December 1978 and concluded that Jones had committed suicide. Stephan, the son of Jones, suggested that his father might have instructed someone else to kill him. Jones&#39;s body was found to have high levels of barbiturate pentobarbital. This could have been deadly for those with low physiological tolerance. Jones&#39;s body and remains were cremated. They were then scattered in the Atlantic Ocean.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Guyanese soldiers put the Jones brothers under house arrest for five days. They interrogated them regarding the deaths in Georgetown. Stephan was accused by Guyanese soldiers of being involved in the deaths. He was then placed in a Guyanese prison where he remained for three months. Johnny Cobb and Tim, both from the Temple basketball teams, were taken to Jonestown for identification of bodies. Jim Jones Jr. returned to the U.S. after which he was placed under surveillance. While he lived with Suzanne, his older sister, whose views were opposed to the Temple, a few months later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Jonestown saw the deaths of five members of Jones&#39;s extended family: his wife, four children and spouses and five grandchildren. John Victor Stoen died in Jonestown. His body was found outside Jones&#39;s house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Marceline instructed Jones that her assets be given to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in a signed letter found at the time of Jones&#39;s death. The Peoples Temple secretary had already made arrangements that $7.3 million (29 million dollars in 2020) in Temple funds would be transferred to Guyana&#39;s Soviet Embassy. While most of the money was held electronically and in foreign bank accounts, $680,000 (or $2,904,097) in 2020 dollars was kept in cash. Three couriers were hired by the Soviets to transport the cash. They claimed to have concealed most of the money, and were detained by the couriers before they reached their destination.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Reactions and Legacy</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;The Jonestown Massacre became a worldwide phenomenon due to the extensive media coverage it received. Jones attempted to blame outsiders for the deaths, but this became more apparent as awareness spread. Jones&#39;s followers received a multitude of explanations from critics and apologists. The Soviet Union publicly disassociated itself from Jones, referring to his &quot;bastardization&rdquo; of the concept revolutionary suicide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;American Christian leaders branded Jones Satanic and said that Jones&#39; teachings and actions were not connected to traditional Christianity. Billy Graham stated in an article entitled &quot;On Satan And Jonestown &#39;&#39; that it was a mistake to label Jones and his cult Christian. Graham was joined in claiming that Jones was demonically possessed by other prominent Christian leaders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Disciples responded to Jonestown&#39;s deaths by making significant changes in ministerial ethics, and creating a new process to expel ministers. Jones was reported by the Disciples in a press release. They then expelled the People&#39;s Temple.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Rumours</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;circulated that people from Peoples Temple in San Francisco were planning hit squads against critics and opponents of the church. To protect media outlets and other targets, law enforcement intervened. Peoples Temple&#39;s San Francisco Headquarters was attacked by media, angry protestors and loved ones of the dead. Ijames, who was returning from Jonestown in 1978 to assume leadership in San Francisco, was left to address the public. Jones denied any connection to the deaths at first. He also claimed the events were orchestrated by church enemies. He eventually admitted the truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Peoples Temple supporters, especially politicians, had difficulty explaining their connection to Jones after the deaths. After some reflection, many admitted to having been tricked and manipulated by Jones. President Carter and the first wife tried to minimize their links to Jones. San Francisco Mayor George Moscone stated that he vomited after hearing of the massacre. He called the families and friends of many victims to express his regret and offer his sympathy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&nbsp;The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Congress conducted investigations into Jonestown&#39;s massacre. Although people and groups gave tips to the FBI about the Peoples Temple before the massacre, no investigation was conducted. The investigation was primarily concerned with why the authorities, especially the United States State </span><span>Department weren&#39;t</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;aware of Jonestown&#39;s abuses. Although Peoples Temple fell shortly after the 1978 events, many people continued to follow Jones&#39; teachings in the 1980s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;There has been a lot of literature and research on the subject since the Jonestown Massacre. The Jonestown Massacre has inspired many documentaries, films and books. Jim Jones and Jonestown&#39;s events had a profound impact on society&rsquo;s perception of cults. After the Jonestown events, the widely-used expression &quot;Drinking the Kool-Aid,&quot; was created. However, Flavor Aid was the actual beverage that was consumed at the massacre.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
