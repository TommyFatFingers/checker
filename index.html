    Jim Jones
   </p>
   <p>
    James Warren Jones, born May 13, 1931, died November 18, 1978. He was an American cult leader and political activist. Jones also served as a preacher and faith healer. Jones led the Peoples Temple between 1955 and 1978, a new religious movement. Jones and his circle of friends orchestrated a mass killing-suicide in Jonestown, Guyana on November 18, 1978. This was what Jones called "revolutionary suicide". Jonestown and the events that took place at Jonestown had a profound impact on society's perceptions of cults.
   </p><p>
    Jones was a child who developed an affinity for Pentecostalism as well as a desire to preach. Jones was ordained as an Independent Assemblies of God Christian minister. He attracted his first followers during participation in the Pentecostal Latter Rain movement, and the Healing Revival in the 1950s. His appearances in campaign campaigns with prominent leaders of the movements, Joseph Mattsson Boze and William Branham, helped Jones to gain popularity and their endorsement for his ministry. In 1955, Jones established the Peoples Temple of Indianapolis. Jones was influenced by Father Divine in 1956 and the Peace Mission movement. Jones was a pioneer in civil rights activism and founded the Temple as an integrated congregation. He also promoted Christian socialism. Jones joined the Disciples in 1964 and was ordained as a minister. His attraction to the Disciples was due to their tolerance and autonomy that allowed Jones to hold different views within the denomination.

    Jones moved the Temple from New York to California in 1965. Jones established the group's headquarters in San Francisco. He became involved in charitable and political activities throughout the 1970s. Jones made connections with prominent California politicians, and was elected chairman of the San Francisco Housing Authority Commission. As Jones began to reject traditional Christianity in the 1960s, abuse reports began to surface. He also began promoting a form communism called "Apostolic Socialism" as well as making claims about his divinity. Jones began to control his Peoples Temple followers, which at its peak had more than 3,000 members. Jones's followers adopted a communal lifestyle where many gave up their property and income to Jones and Peoples Temple, who governed all aspects of community life.

    After a period of negative media coverage and reports about abuse at Peoples Temple in the press, Jones ordered construction of Jonestown in Guyana in 1974. He convinced or compelled many followers to move there with him. Jones claimed that he was creating a socialist paradise without the oppression of America's government. Reports of human rights violations and allegations that Jonestown was holding people against their will surfaced in 1978. Leo Ryan, a U.S. Representative, led a delegation that visited the commune in November 1978 to investigate these allegations. Ryan was on board a return flight along with former Temple members who wanted to leave. Four other Jonestown gunmen then shot Ryan. Jones ordered a mass murder-suicide, killing 909 members of the commune, including 304 children. Nearly all of them died from Flavor Aid laced cyanide.

    Early life
   </p>
   <p>
    James Warren Jones was born May 13, 1931 in Crete, Indiana to Lynetta Putnam and James Thurman Jones. Jones's father, a World War I vet who was disabled from breathing problems after sustaining injuries in an attack with chemical weapons, was severely injured.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    The death of his father caused financial problems. The Jones family was forced from their home in 1934 after they failed to pay their mortgage payments. Their relatives bought a shack in Lynn for them to live. Jones grew up in the new home that lacked electricity and plumbing. The family tried to make an income farming in Lynn but failed again when Jones' father became more ill. Their extended family provided financial support and food assistance, as they often didn't have enough. Sometimes, they would forage in nearby fields and forests to supplement their food.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Multiple Jones biographers claim that Jones' mother was "no natural mother instincts" and she often neglected her son. His extended family threatened to end Jones' financial aid if his mother didn't get a job. Jones began school. Jones's father was also hospitalized several times because of his illness. Jones was often left without his parents during his childhood. Jones was taken care of by relatives and neighbors.

    Early political and religious influences
   </p>
   <p>
    Myrtle Kennedy was the wife of the pastor of Nazarene Church. She developed a special connection with Jones. Jones was given a Bible by her and encouraged to read it. She also taught him the holiness code of Nazarene Church. Jones attended many of Lynn's churches as a child, and was baptized at several. Jones was a passionate preacher from a young age and began practicing in private. His mother claimed she was disturbed that Jones imitated the pastor of the Apostolic Pentecostal Church. She unsuccessfully tried to stop him from attending church services.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones' poor family circumstances were a cause for concern, but his neighbors said that Jones was an unusual child who was obsessed about religion and death. According to Jones' biographer, he was unable to make friends so he developed unusual interests. His neighbors were most impressed by his unusual religious beliefs, but they also reported more serious misbehaviors. His mother was forced to pay the price for her son's thefts of candy from local merchants. Jones used offensive profanity a lot. He would greet his neighbors and friends with the words "Good morning, son of a bitch" (or "Hello, dirty bastard")
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones was a passionate believer in social doctrines and religion. Jones was a voracious reader and became an avid student of Adolf Hitler's, Karl Marx, Mao Zedong, Mahatma Gandhi, and Joseph Stalin. He would spend hours at the library and bring books home to read in the evenings. Jones was not radical in his youth, despite having studied different political systems.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones commented on his childhood and stated that he was "ready to kill" by the third grade. Jones said, "I was so hostile and aggressive, I was ready for death." I was never shown love or understanding by anyone. In those days, a parent was expected to accompany a child to school functions. Everybody was present at school performances. I am standing there alone. I was always alone." Tom Reiterman was a biographer who wrote that Jones' attraction to religion was strongly influenced his desire for a family.
   </p>

    Education and marriage
   </p>
   <p>
    Jones was a standout among his peers in high school. Jones almost always had his Bible with him. He was a dissident among other youth because of his religious beliefs. He confronted them often for their drinking, smoking, and dancing. Jones was at a Richmond baseball game, and was disturbed by how the African Americans were treated. Jones was shocked by the treatment of African Americans at that game and became a strong opponent to racism.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones's parents divorced in 1946 after they separated. Jones and his mother moved to Richmond, Indiana, where Jones graduated from Richmond High School on December 28, 1948. After the divorce, Jones and his mother lost their financial support. Jones started working as an orderly in Richmond's Reid Hospital to support himself. Although Jones was respected by senior management, staff later remembered that Jones had exhibited unprofessional behavior towards patients and coworkers. Jones met Marceline Baldwin, a nurse-intraining, while working at Reid Hospital.
   </p>

   <p>
    Jones arrived in Bloomington, Indiana, in November 1948. He was originally going to become a doctor. However, he changed his mind soon after. Jones became inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt's speech about the plight African-Americans and began to support communism and other radical political views while at University.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones and Marceline Baldwin remained in a relationship throughout Jones' college years. The couple were married on June 12, 1949. Their first home was in Bloomington. Marceline worked at a nearby hospital, while Jones went to college. Jones and Marceline were both Methodists, and they quickly fell in love with church. Jones's opposition to the Methodist church’s racial segregationist policies was a strain on their marriage. Jones eventually gave in and started attending a local Methodist church every Sunday morning. Jones insisted on attending church every week but privately asked his wife to accept atheism.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    The couple moved to Indianapolis in 1951 after they had attended Indiana University for two more years. Jones continued his education by taking night classes at Butler University. He eventually earned a secondary education degree in 1961. Jones, then 20, began attending meetings of the Communist Party USA in Indianapolis in 1951.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones' family was harassed by government officials for being members of the Communist Party in 1952. Jones's mother was once harassed by FBI agents because she attended a communist meeting along with her son. Jones was frustrated by the persecution of communists within the U.S. Jones reflected on his time in the Communist Party and asked himself: "How can I show my Marxism?" Jones thought, "Infiltrate the Church."

    Peoples Temple
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones told his wife and their family in 1952 that he was going to become a Methodist minister. He believed the church was ready for "real socialism to be put into practice." Jones was shocked when a Methodist District Superintendent helped him get started in the church. He knew Jones to be communist.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones was appointed student pastor at Sommerset Southside Methodist Church in 1952. He launched a project to build a playground for all children. Jones was a Methodist student pastor and continued to speak at Pentecostal churches. Jones was fired from the Methodist Church in 1954, allegedly for stealing church funds. However, Jones later claimed that he had left the church because the leaders forbade his integration of blacks.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones, a Pentecostal Latter Rain member, visited Columbus, Indiana in 1953. There, a woman prophesied about Jones' great ministry and that she was a prophet. Jones was shocked by the endorsement but accepted the call to preach, and rose to address the crowd. Pentecostalism was present in the midst the Healing Revival, Latter Rain movements of the 1950s.
   </p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones believed that Jones had a better chance to be a preacher because of the Latter Rain's racially integrated movement. He convinced his wife to join the Pentecostals and leave the Methodist church. Jones started preaching at the Laurel Street Tabernacle, an Indianapolis Pentecostal Assemblies church, in 1953. Jones led healing revivals at the Tabernacle until 1955, and then he began to travel and give talks to other churches of the Latter Rain movement. He was invited to speak at the 1953 Detroit convention.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    The Latter Rain movement was strongly opposed by the Assemblies of God. They assigned a new pastor in 1955 to the Laurel Street Tabernacle, who enforced their ban on healing revivals. Jones was forced to quit and found Wings of Healing. This new church would be later renamed Peoples Temple. Jones's new church attracted only twenty people who had come from the Laurel Street Tabernacle. He was unable to finance his vision. Jones recognized the need for publicity and sought out a way to promote his ministry and recruit new members.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Latter Rain Movement
   </p>
   <p>
    Jones became a close associate of the Independent Assemblies of God, an international group of churches that embraced the Latter Rain movement. The IAoG did not have any requirements for ordaining priests, but they were open to divine healing techniques. Jones had his first meeting with William Branham in June 1955. Branham was a global Healing Revival leader and healing evangelist.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Joseph Mattsson -Boze, a leader of the Latter Rain movement, and the IAoG, ordained Jones as an IAoG minister in 1956. Jones rose quickly to prominence within the group and organized and hosted an Indianapolis healing convention, June 11-15th 1956 at Cadle Tabernacle. He was looking for a celebrity to attract crowds and so he agreed to share the pulpit with Branham.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    William Branham was instrumental in launching and popularizing Jim Jones' ministry in 1956.
   </p>
   <p>
    Branham was well-known for telling people their names, addresses, and reasons they came to pray before pronouncing them cured. Jones was fascinated by Branham's methods, and began to perform the same feats. The first joint campaign attracted 11,000 people to Jones' meetings with Branham. Branham gave a prophetic endorsement to Jones and his ministry at the convention, stating that God used the convention in order to bring forth a new great ministry.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Many people believed Jones's performance implied that he had a supernatural gift. This endorsement was combined with Branham's endorsement led to the rapid growth of People's Temple. Jones was especially effective in recruiting African American attendees to the conventions. A newspaper report claims that Peoples Temple saw an increase in attendance of 1,000 peoples thanks to the publicity Branham gave Jones and Peoples Temple.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones changed the name of his church to "Peoples Temple Christian Church Full Gospel" following the convention. This was to make it more closely associated with Full Gospel Pentecostalism. The name was later reduced to the Peoples Temple. Jones was a part of a series multi-state revival efforts with Branham during the second half 1950s. Jones claimed that he was a promoter and follower of Branham's "Message" in this period. Peoples Temple hosted an international Pentecostal convention, which was headlined again by Branham in 1957. Jones was able to establish connections within the Latter Rain movement through the conventions and the support of Mattsson-Boze and Branham.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones adopted the Manifested Sons of God doctrine, one of the Latter Rain's most important doctrines. He continued to promote it for the rest of Jones' life. William Branham and Latter Rain promoted the belief in the possibility that individuals could manifest God's supernatural powers and superhuman abilities. These people believed that such a manifestation would signal the second coming of Christ and that those endowed with special gifts would bring about a new era of heaven on Earth. Jones was intrigued by the idea and used it to promote his utopian ideas, eventually claiming that he was a manifestation God. Jones began to believe that he was "Christ the Revolution" by the late 1960s.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Branham had a significant influence on Jones, who adopted some elements of Branham’s methods, doctrines and style. Jones, like Branham, would claim to be Elijah, the prophet, the voice and manifestation of God and that the end was near. Branham taught Jones some of the most effective recruitment strategies. After a bitter dispute with Branham, Jones left the Latter Rain movement. Jones also prophesied Branham’s death. They disagreed possibly because of Branham’s racial teachings and Branham’s vocal opposition to communism.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Peace Mission Movement
   </p>
   <p>
    Jones was introduced to Father Divine by the Latter Rain movement. He was an African American spiritual leader of International Peace Mission. Jones was often ridiculed by Pentecostal ministers because of his claims of divinity. Jones visited Father Divine's Peace Mission, Philadelphia in 1956. Jones explained that his mission to the Peace Mission was to "give an authentic and objective, unbiased, as well as objective statement" to fellow Pentecostal ministers.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Another important influence on Jones's ministry was Divine. Although Jones publicly disavowed many Father Divine's teachings and began to promote Divines teachings on communal living. He also started to implement many of the outreach practices he saw at the Peace Mission, such as setting up a soup Kitchen and giving out food and clothing to those in need.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones paid a second visit in 1958 to Father Divine to learn more about his methods. Jones told his congregation that he wanted to succeed Father Divine. He also made comparisons between the two ministries. Jones started to implement the discipline practices he learned form Father Divine, which gradually took over the lives and activities of Peoples Temple members.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Disciples of Christ
   </p>
   <p>
    Jones began to separate from Pentecostalism, the Latter Rain movement and Pentecostalism. He sought out an organization that would accept all his beliefs. Peoples Temple joined Disciples of Christ in 1960. Its headquarters were located near Indianapolis. Archie Ijames assured Jones the organization would accept his political views, and Jones was finally ordained in 1964 by Disciples of Christ.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones was ordained as Disciples minister in a time when the requirements to ordination were varied and Disciples membership was available to all churches. Both 1974 and 1977, allegations were made against the Disciples leadership regarding abuse at Peoples Temple. They did an investigation at the time and found no evidence of wrongdoing. Disciples of Jesus Christ considered Peoples Temple an "exemplary Christian ministry, overcoming human differences, and dedicated to humanitarian services." Between 1966 and 1977, $1.1 million was contributed by Peoples Temple ($4,697.803 in 2020 dollars). Jones and Peoples Temple were still part of the Disciples up to the Jonestown massacre.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Integration of racial groups
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Charles Boswell, the mayor of Indianapolis, appointed Jones as director of the local human right commission in 1960. Boswell advised Jones to keep his profile low, but Jones used the position to gain new outlets for his views via local radio and television. He refused to stop his public actions when asked by the mayor and other commissioners. Jones received wildly applauded at a meeting with the NAACP, the Urban League, when he encouraged his audience members to be more militant. He concluded his speech by saying, "Let your people go!" ".
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones was the commission director and helped integrate racially churches, restaurants and telephone companies, as well as the Indianapolis Police Department and a theater and amusement park. He also assisted with the Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital's racial integration efforts. Jones was there to comfort the black community and advise white families not move when swastikas had been painted on two homes.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones created sting operations to capture restaurants that refused to serve black patrons. He also wrote to American Nazi Party leaders, and they responded to Jones' media inquiries. Jones was admitted to hospital after he suffered a fall in 1961. Jones was accidentally taken to the hospital's black ward. He refused to move and began making beds for black patients and emptying their bedpans. The hospital officials decided to de-segregate its wards due to political pressures.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
    Jones was criticised in Indiana for his integrationist views. White supremacists made Peoples Temple a target. A swastika was put on the Temple, a stick dynamite was left in the Temple coal pile and a dead cat was thrown at Jones after a threat phone call. Jones's actions generated more publicity, however. Indianapolis had become a more diverse city by 1961. "Jim Jones" was almost completely responsible.
